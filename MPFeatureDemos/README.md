# MPFeatureDemos

## Overview

The **MPFeatureDemos** directory contains a collection of demonstration projects showcasing various features and functionalities of Mini Programs (MP). Each demo is designed to illustrate specific capabilities, providing developers with practical examples and insights into how to implement these features in their own projects.

## Structure

The directory is organized as follows:

- **subPackages/**: In Mini Programs, the size of a single package cannot exceed 2MB. If the package exceeds this size limit, you will be unable to preview or upload the program. It is recommended that developers host local static resources on a server or utilize subPackages to optimize package size. This directory demonstrates the usage of subPackages.

## Getting Started

To get started with the demos:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the desired feature demo folder directly in the MP Developer Tool to preview and run the demo locally.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have additional features or demos to share, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
